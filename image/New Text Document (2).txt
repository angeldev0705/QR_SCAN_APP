We have an App that scans QR codes and the Indian Programmer has a "Festival" on this weekend, instead of working for us even Friday.

The API was urgent but the festival is even more urgent.

If you can fix the APP for us so it works and scans our QR codes NOW please bid.
Skills Required

API works and give response

The main thing we need is the App sends "scan" 1 to server so we can see the code was scanned

We have one problem
QR was set with date in sthis format
1029
but QRs on Sunday only 111
So I want app to add a 0 itself 1101
